        <section class="about-me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings! I am Kris Yotam, a classical educator, lifelong learner, and passionate researcher. My journey has been shaped by a relentless curiosity and a commitment to the pursuit of knowledge. I have spent years refining my understanding of various disciplines—from the humanities to technology—and I aim to share these insights through this platform.</p>
            <p>As an autodidact and tutor, I believe deeply in the value of self-directed learning and the transformative power of education. My work is an ongoing pursuit of the true, the good, and the beautiful, inspired by classical principles and grounded in practical wisdom.</p>

        <!-- My Mission Section -->
        <section class="my-mission">
            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>My mission is simple: to guide others toward the true, the good, and the beautiful. In a world that often values the superficial, I advocate for education that shapes the soul, not just the mind. I believe in classical education, which is not only about imparting knowledge but nurturing virtue, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the world around us.</p>
            <p>I aim to inspire individuals to think critically, act with purpose, and live according to timeless principles. My work here is not just to teach, but to help others transform their lives through education that leads to flourishing.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>With over a decade of experience in various fields, including teaching, research, and software development, I have cultivated a deep understanding of both classical education and modern methodologies. Below are some of the roles I have undertaken:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Classical Educator and Tutor</strong> – Educating students in subjects ranging from philosophy and literature to logic and mathematics. I emphasize the development of critical thinking and moral character.</li>
                <li><strong>Researcher</strong> – Engaging in interdisciplinary research that bridges the gap between classical studies and modern thought, particularly in areas related to philosophy, history, and the sciences.</li>
                <li><strong>Programmer</strong> – Applying my analytical skills to the world of technology, where I design and develop software that serves both practical and educational purposes.</li>

        <!-- Personal Philosophy Section -->
        <section class="personal-philosophy">
            <h2>My Personal Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At the core of my philosophy is the belief that education should lead to a deeper understanding of God’s design for the world. As a believer in the Bible as the ultimate authority, I see my work as a reflection of divine wisdom. I practice asceticism and minimalism, aiming to live simply and focus on what is truly important—knowledge, virtue, and faith.</p>
            <p>I view education as a tool for moral and intellectual transformation, with the goal of shaping individuals who can contribute meaningfully to society while living lives of integrity, humility, and wisdom.</p>
